In this post, we introduce a new unified framework for writing core ML training logic as oblivious training functions . Maggy enables you to reuse the same training code whether training small models on your laptop or reusing the same code to scale out hyperparameter tuning or distributed deep learning on a cluster. Maggy enables the replacement of the current waterfall development process for distributed ML applications, where code is rewritten at every stage to account for the different distribution context. Maggy uses the same distribution transparent training function in all steps of the machine learning development process. Quick Start # Maggy uses PySpark as an engine to distribute the training processes. To get started, install Maggy in the Python environment used by your Spark Cluster, or install Maggy in your local Python environment with the 'spark' extra, to run on Spark in local mode: pip install maggy The programming model consists of wrapping the code containing the model training inside a function. Inside that wrapper function provide all imports and parts that make up your experiment. Single run experiment: def train_fn (): # This is your training iteration loop for i in range ( number_iterations ): ... # add the maggy reporter to report the metric to be optimized reporter . broadcast ( metric = accuracy ) ... # Return metric to be optimized or any metric to be logged return accuracy from maggy import experiment result = experiment . lagom ( train_fn = train_fn , name = 'MNIST' ) lagom is a Swedish word meaning \"just the right amount\". This is how MAggy uses your resources. Documentation # Full documentation is available at maggy.ai Contributing # There are various ways to contribute, and any contribution is welcome, please follow the CONTRIBUTING guide to get started. Issues # Issues can be reported on the official GitHub repo of Maggy.

Payberah, Vladimir Vlassov, Jim Dowling Abstract # Running extensive experiments is essential for building Machine Learning (ML) models. Such experiments usually require iterative execution of many trials with varying run times. In recent years, Apache Spark has become the de-facto standard for parallel data processing in the industry, in which iterative processes are im- plemented within the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) execution model. The BSP approach is also being used to parallelize ML trials in Spark. However, the BSP task synchronization barriers prevent asynchronous execution of trials, which leads to a reduced number of trials that can be run on a given computational budget. In this paper, we introduce Maggy, an open-source framework based on Spark, to execute ML trials asynchronously in parallel, with the ability to early stop poorly performing trials. In the experiments, we compare Maggy with the BSP execution of parallel trials in Spark and show that on random hyperparameter search on a con- volutional neural network for the Fashion-MNIST dataset Maggy reduces the required time to execute a fixed number of trials by 33% to 58%, without any loss in the final model accuracy.

Ormenisan, Jim Dowling Abstract # Building and productionizing Machine Learning (ML) models is a process of interdependent steps of iterative code updates, including exploratory model design, hyperparameter tuning, ablation experiments, and model training. Industrial-strength ML involves doing this at scale, using many compute resources, and this requires rewriting the training code to account for distribution. The result is that moving from a single host program to a cluster hinders iterative development of the software, as iterative development would require multiple versions of the software to be maintained and kept consistent. In this paper, we introduce the distribution oblivious training function as an abstraction for ML development in Python, whereby developers can reuse the same training function when running a notebook on a laptop or performing scale-out hyperparameter search and distributed training on clusters. Programs written in our framework look like industry-standard ML programs as we factor out dependencies using best-practice programming idioms (such as functions to generate models and data batches). We believe that our approach takes a step towards unifying single-host and distributed ML development.

An ablation study consists of several trials, where one trial could be, e.g., removing the last convolutional layer of a CNN model, retraining the model, and observing the resulting performance. However, as machine learning architectures become ever deeper and data sizes keep growing, there is an explosion in the number of different architecture combinations that need to be evaluated to understand their relative performance. Maggy provides a declarative way to define ablation experiments for model architectures and training datasets, in a way that eliminates the need for maintaining redundant copies of code for an ablation study. Furthermore, our framework enables parallel execution of ablation trials without requiring the developers to modify their code, which leads to shorter study times and better resource utilization. Simple Example # In order to use Maggy for Ablation studies, first we need to define a model generator function. from maggy.ablation import AblationStudy ablation_study = AblationStudy ( 'titanic_train_dataset' , training_dataset_version = 1 , label_name = 'survived' ) Add the features to ablate # We perform feature ablation by including features in our AblationStudy instance. Including a feature means that there will be a trial where the model will be trained without that feature. In other words, you include features in the ablation study so that they will be excluded from the training dataset. In this example, we have the following features in our training dataset: ['age', 'fare', 'parch', 'pclass', 'sex', 'sibsp', 'survived'] You can include features using features.include() method of your AblationStudy instance, by passing the names of the features, either separately or as a list of strings: #include features one by one ablation_study . features . include ( 'pclass' ) # include a list of features list_of_features = [ 'fare' , 'sibsp' ] ablation_study . features . include ( list_of_features ) Add the model layers to ablate # By model ablation we mean removing the components of the model, retraining and observing the resulting performance. Depending on which component of the model you want to ablate, we could have different types of model ablation, but one thing they all share in common is that we should have one base model in order to compare the other models with it. So we should define a base model generator function that returns a tf.keras.Model . Maybe the simplest type of model ablation that can be performed on a sequential deep learning model is to remove some of its layers, so let\u2019s just do that. We call this layer ablation. In Keras, when you are adding layers to your Sequential model, you can provide a name argument with a custom name. The Maggy ablator then uses these names to identify and remove the layers. Then, for each trial, the ablator returns a corresponding model generator function that differs from the base model generator in terms of its layers. By the way, if you do not provide a name argument while adding a layer, that layer\u2019s name will be prefixed by its layer class name, followed by an incremental number, e.g., dense_1. In the following cell, we define a base model generator function that once executed will return a Sequential model: def base_model_generator (): model = tf . keras . Sequential () model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 64 , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 64 , name = 'my_dense_two' , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 32 , name = 'my_dense_three' , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 32 , name = 'my_dense_four' , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 2 , name = 'my_dense_sigmoid' , activation = 'sigmoid' )) # output layer model . add ( tf . keras . layers . Dense ( 1 , activation = 'linear' )) return model ablation_study . model . set_base_model_generator ( base_model_generator ) Adding layers to your ablation study is easy - just pass their names to model.layers.include() , or pass a list of strings of the names. Of course, these names should match the names you define in your base model generator function: # include some single layers in the ablation study ablation_study . model . layers . include ( 'my_dense_two' , 'my_dense_three' , 'my_dense_four' , 'my_dense_sigmoid' ) For smaller models, it might make sense to add the layers to the model one-by-one. However, in many well-known neural network architectures, such as Transformers, we have tens or hundreds of layers that sometimes come in blocks or modules, and are usually generated using constructs like for loops. In Maggy, you can easily include such layers in your ablation study experiment, using model.layers.include_groups() method of your AblationStudy instance. You can either pass it a list of layers that should be regarded as a single layer group, or provide it with a prefix argument: # add a layer group using a list ablation_study . model . layers . include_groups ([ 'my_dense_two' , 'my_dense_four' ]) # add a layer group using a prefix ablation_study . model . layers . include_groups ( prefix = 'my_dense' ) Write the training logic # Now the only thing you need to do is to write your training code in a Python function. You can name this function whatever you wish, but we will refer to it as the training function. The model_function and dataset_function used in the code are generated by the ablator per each trial, and you should call them in your code. This is your run-of-the-mill TensorFlow/Keras code: # wrap your code in a Python function def training_fn ( dataset_function , model_function ): import tensorflow as tf epochs = 5 batch_size = 10 tf_dataset = dataset_function ( epochs , batch_size ) model = model_function () model . compile ( optimizer = tf . keras . optimizers . Adam ( 0.001 ), loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , metrics = [ 'accuracy' ]) history = model . fit ( tf_dataset , epochs = 5 , steps_per_epoch = 30 , verbose = 0 ) return float ( history . history [ 'accuracy' ][ - 1 ]) And, lagom! Lagom is a Swedish word that means \u201cjust the right amount\u201d, and that is how Maggy uses your resources to for parallel trials. You should provide lagom with an ablator. So far, we have implemented the most natural ablator of them all: LOCO, which stands for \u201cLeave One Component Out\u201d. This ablator will generate one trial per each component included in the ablation study. However, Maggy\u2019s developer API allows you to define your own ablator, in case you want to get creative. You can also set a name for your experiment so that you can keep history or track its progress in Hopsworks.

Developers can use an existing Optimizer, such as asynchronous successive halving (ASHA), or provide their own one. The basic approach we followed was to add support for the Driver and Executors to communicate via RPCs. The Optimizer that guides hyperparameter search is located on the Driver, and it assigns trials to Executors. Executors periodically send back to the Driver the current performance of their trial, and the Optimizer can decide to early-stop its ongoing trial, followed by sending the Executor with a new trial. Because of the impedance mismatch between trials and the stage-/task-based execution model of Spark, we are blocking Executors with long-running tasks to run multiple trials per task. In this way, Executors are always kept busy running trials, and global information needed for efficient early-stopping is aggregated in the Optimizer.

With Maggy, the code will be like this: #datasets preparation ... #model definition ... def training_function ( model , train_set , test_set , hparams ): #model training ... #model testing ... #configure maggy, pass training_function to maggy and run the experiment ...

In order to leverage on the early stopping capabilities of maggy, you need to make use of the maggy reporter API. By including the reporter in your training loop, you are telling maggy which metric to report back to the experiment driver for optimization and to check for global stopping. It is as easy as adding reporter.broadcast(metric=YOUR_METRIC) for example at the end of your epoch or batch training step and adding a reporter argument to your function signature.
