# How to contribute

Contributions are welcome! Not familiar with the codebase yet? No problem!
There are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,
helping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding
new features and patches.

## Reporting issues

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) to help
  us identify the issue. This also helps to check that the issue is not with
  your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an
  exception.
- List your Python, Hopsworks and Maggy versions. If possible, check if this
  issue is already fixed in the repository.

## Contributing Code

Code contributions, in the form of patches or features are welcome. In order to
start developing, please follow the instructions below, to enable [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and
ensure style and codechecks.

### Python Setup

- Fork Maggy to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` button.

- Clone your fork locally:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/[username]/maggy.git
  cd maggy
  ```

- Add the upstream repository as a remote to update later::

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/logicalclocks/maggy.git
  git fetch upstream
  ```

- Create a new Python environment with your favourite environment manager, e.g. virtualenv or conda:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  . env/bin/activate
  # or "env\Scripts\activate" on Windows
  ```

  or with conda:

  ```bash
  conda create --name maggy python=3.8
  conda activate maggy
  ```

  verify your python version - we are using Python 3.8:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

- Install Maggy in editable mode with development dependencies::

  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```

- Install pre-commit_ and then activate its hooks. pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Maggy uses pre-commit to ensure code-style and code formatting through [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8):

  ```bash
  pip install --user pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

  Afterwards, pre-commit will run whenever you commit.

- To run formatting and code-style separately, you can configure your IDE, such as VSCode, to use black and flake8, or run them via the command line:

  ```bash
  flake8 maggy
  black maggy
  ```

### Start coding

- Create a branch to identify the issue or feature you would like to work on.
- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, committing as you go.
- Follow [PEP8](https://pep8.org/).
- Push your commits to GitHub and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
