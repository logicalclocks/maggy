class AblationStudy(object):
    """The `AblationStudy` object is the entry point to define an ablation
    study with maggy. This object can subsequently be passed as an argument
    when the experiment is launched with `experiment.lagom()`.

    Sample usage:

    >>> from maggy.ablation import AblationStudy
    >>> ablation_study = AblationStudy('titanic_train_dataset',
    >>>     label_name='survived')

    The above code will create an `AblationStudy` instance with a default
    dataset generator function, which uses the project feature store to
    return a `TFRecordDataset` based on the feature ablation configuration
    (for an example, look at `ablator.LOCO.get_dataset_generator()`).
    If you want to provide your own dataset generator function,
    define it before creating the `AblationStudy` instance and pass it to
    the initializer or use 'set_dataset_generator()'. In the example below
    we assume the user has created a function called `create_tf_dataset()`
    that returns a `TFRecordDataset`:

    >>> ablation_study = AblationStudy('titanic_train_dataset',
            label_name='survived', dataset_generator=create_tf_dataset)

    In case you want to perform feature ablation with your custom dataset
    generator function, then of course your function should be able to return
    specific datasets based on the feature ablation configuration.
    For an example implementation of such logic, look at
    `ablator.LOCO.get_dataset_generator()`.

    After creating your `AblationStudy` instance, you should define your study
    configuration by including layers and features that you want to be ablated:

    >>> ablation_study.features.include('pclass', 'fare')
    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include('my_dense_two',
    >>>     'my_dense_three')

    You can also add a layer group using a list:

    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include_groups(['my_dense_two',
    >>>     'my_dense_four'])

    Or add a layer group using a prefix:

    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include_groups(prefix='my_dense')

    Next you should define a base model function using the layer and feature
    names you previously specified:

    >>> # you only need to add the `name` parameter to layer initializers
    >>> def base_model_generator():
    >>>     import tensorflow as tf
    >>>     model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(..., name='my_dense_two', ...)
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(..., name='my_dense_sigmoid', ...)
    >>>     # output layer
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear'))
    >>>     return model

    Make sure to include the generator function in the study:

    >>> ablation_study.model.set_base_model_generator(base_model_generator)

    Last but not least you can define your actual training function:

    >>> from maggy import experiment
    â€‹
    >>> def training_function(dataset_function, model_function):
    >>>     import tensorflow as tf
    >>>     epochs = 5
    >>>     batch_size = 10
    >>>     tf_dataset = dataset_function(epochs, batch_size)
    >>>     model = model_function()
    >>>     model.compile(optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001),
    >>>             loss='binary_crossentropy',
    >>>             metrics=['accuracy'])

    >>>     history = model.fit(tf_dataset, epochs=epochs, steps_per_epoch=30)
    >>>     return float(history.history['acc'][-1])

    Lagom the experiment:

    >>> result = experiment.lagom(train_fn=training_function,
    >>>                         experiment_type='ablation',
    >>>                         ablation_study=ablation_study,
    >>>                         ablator='loco',
    >>>                         name='Titanic-LOCO')
