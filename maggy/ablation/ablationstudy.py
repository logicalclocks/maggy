class AblationStudy(object):
    """The `AblationStudy` object is the entry point to define an ablation
    study with maggy. This object can subsequently be passed as an argument
    when the experiment is launched with `experiment.lagom()`.

    Sample usage:

    >>> from maggy.ablation import AblationStudy
    >>> ablation_study = AblationStudy('titanic_train_dataset',
    >>>     label_name='survived')

    Define your study by including layers and features, which should be
    ablated:

    >>> ablation_study.features.include('pclass', 'fare')
    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include('my_dense_two',
    >>>     'my_dense_three')

    You can also add a layer group using a list:

    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include_groups(['my_dense_two',
    >>>     'my_dense_four'])

    Or add a layer group using a prefix:

    >>> ablation_study.model.layers.include_groups(prefix='my_dense')

    Next you should define a base model function using the layer and feature
    names you previously specified:

    >>> # you only need to add the `name` parameter to layer initializers
    >>> def base_model_generator():
    >>>     model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(..., name='my_dense_two', ...)
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(..., name='my_dense_sigmoid', ...)
    >>>     # output layer
    >>>     model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear'))
    >>>     return model

    Make sure to include the generator function in the study:

    >>> ablation_study.model.set_base_model_generator(base_model_generator)

    Last but not least you can define your actual training function:

    >>> from maggy import experiment
    >>> from maggy.callbacks import KerasBatchEnd
    â€‹
    >>> def training_function(dataset_function, model_function, reporter):
    >>>     import tensorflow as tf
    >>>     epochs = 5
    >>>     batch_size = 10
    >>>     tf_dataset = dataset_function(epochs, batch_size)
    >>>     model = model_function()
    >>>     model.compile(optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001),
    >>>             loss='binary_crossentropy',
    >>>             metrics=['accuracy'])
    >>>     ### Maggy REPORTER
    >>>     callbacks = [KerasBatchEnd(reporter, metric='acc')]
    >>>     history = model.fit(tf_dataset, epochs=5, steps_per_epoch=30)
    >>>     return float(history.history['acc'][-1])

    Lagom the experiment:

    >>> result = experiment.lagom(map_fun=training_function,
    >>>                         experiment_type='ablation',
    >>>                         ablation_study=ablation_study,
    >>>                         ablator='loco',
    >>>                         name='Titanic-LOCO',
