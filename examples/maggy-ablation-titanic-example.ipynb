    "In this notebook, we demonstrate Maggy's Ablation API, while using a TensorFlow Keras Sequential model trained on the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). To be able to follow along, make sure you have the Titanic training dataset registered on your Project's Feature Store, as explained [in this example notebook](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/featurestore/datasets/TitanicTrainingDatasetPython.ipynb).\n",

    "## Wait ... What is an *Ablation Study*?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Ablation Study, in medical and psychological research, is a research method in which the roles and functions of an organ, tissue, or any part of a living organism, is examined through its surgical removal and observing the behaviour of the organism in its absence. This method, also known as experimental ablation, was pioneered by the French physiologist [Marie Jean Pierre Flourens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Pierre_Flourens) in the early nineteenth century. Flourens would perform ablative brain surgeries on animals, removing different parts of their nervous systems and observing the effects on their behaviour. This method has since been used in a variety of disciplines, but most prominently in medical and psychological research and neuroscience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Does it Have to Do with Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning, we can define ablation study as *“a scientific examination of a machine learning system by removing its building blocks in order to gain insight on their effects on its overall performance”*. Dataset features and model components are notable examples of these building blocks (hence we use their corresponding terms of **feature ablation** and **model ablation**), but any design choice or module of the system may be included in an ablation study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments and Trials\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think that an ablation study is an *experiment* that consists of several *trials*. For example, each model ablation trial involves training a model with one or more of its components (e.g. a layer) removed. Similarly, a feature ablation trial involves training a model using a different set of dataset features, and observing the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](images/ablation-feature-vs-model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image above shows a sample feature ablation trial (up) and a sample layer ablation trial (down). For example, in the sample layer ablation trial, we remove the last hidden layer from the base model, train the resulting model, and observe its accuracy."

    "## Ablation Studies with Maggy\n",
    "\n",
    "With Maggy, performing ablation studies of your machine learning or deep learning systems is a fairly simple task that consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating an `AblationStudy` instance,\n",
    "2. Specifying the components that you want to ablate by *including* them in your `AblationStudy` instance,\n",
    "3. Defining a *base model generator function* and/or a *dataset generator function*,\n",
    "4. Wrapping your TensorFlow/Keras code in a Python function (let's call it **training function**) that receives two arguments (`model_function` and `dataset_function`), and\n",
    "5. Launching your experiment with Maggy while specifying an *ablation policy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's as simple as that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Changes Should I Make in my TensorFlow/Keras Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so much. You'll see an example shortly, but the most important thing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **model ablation**, you need to define a function that returns a TF/Keras `model`, and use that in your code instead of defining the model in your training function. If you want to perform **layer ablation**, then you should provide a `name` argument while adding layers to your `tf.keras.Sequential` model, and include those names in your `AblationStudy` instance as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **feature ablation**:\n",
    "    - if you have your training dataset in the [**Feature Store**](https://www.logicalclocks.com/featurestorepage) (congratulations! :D) in form of `tfrecord`, you can directly include the features you want to ablate using their names and calling a *dataset generator function* in your training function. The dataset generator functions will be created under the hood by maggy for each feature ablation trial.\n",
    "    - alternatively, you can define your own *dataset generator function* and include it in your `AblationStudy` instance. A separate example notebook will be created to show you how you can do this.\n",
    "    \n",

So we should define a *base model generator function* that returns a `tf.keras.Model`.\n",

Then, for each trial, the ablator returns a corresponding *model generator function* that differs from the base model generator in terms of its layers.\n",
