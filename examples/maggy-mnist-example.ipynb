    "The programming model is that you wrap the code containing the model training inside a wrapper function. Inside that wrapper function provide all imports and parts that make up your experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The function should take the hyperparameters as arguments, plus one additional parameter `reporter` which is needed for reporting the current metric to the experiment driver.\n",
    "2. The function should return the metric that you want to optimize for. This should coincide with the metric being reported in the Keras callback (see next point).\n",
    "3. In order to leverage on the early stopping capabilities of maggy, you need to make use of the maggy reporter API. By including the reporter in your training loop, you are telling maggy which metric to report back to the experiment driver for optimization and to check for early stopping. It is as easy as adding `reporter.broadcast(metric=YOUR_METRIC)` for example at the end of your epoch or batch training step and adding a `reporter` argument to your function signature. If you are not writing your own training loop you can use the pre-written Keras callbacks:\n",

    "    - KerasEpochEnd  \n",
    "(Please see documentation for a detailed explanation.)\n",
